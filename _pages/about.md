I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/). Additionally, I am a member of Project B07 in the [Collaborative Research Center Transregio 224](https://www.crctr224.de/) (Bonn/Mannheim). My supervisors are [Ulrich Wagner](https://ulrichwagner.eu/), [Kathrine von Graevenitz](https://sites.google.com/view/kathrinevongraevenitz/home) and [Mateus Souza](https://sites.google.com/view/mateussouza/home). My main research interests are in environmental economics, development economics and international trade. Please find my CV [here](https://unimannheimde-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/siyzhang_ad_uni-mannheim_de/ERGUiKPfBhJDkZi5l5Pn2lwBjbFdyUqxPVHc7eHa-eUbYA?e=UzpCKa).

<p><strong>I will be on the 2025–26 job market.</strong></p>

Current Research
======
**Road to Green? The Effect of Highway Expansion on Industrial Emissions Intensity** *(**Job Market Paper**)*

This paper examines whether highway expansion, beyond improving connectivity and lowering trade costs, can also reduce the emissions intensity of industrial production. I develop a general equilibrium model in which emissions are an endogenous by-product of firms’ output, and show that highways can lower aggregate emissions intensity by fostering tougher competition and improving resource allocation, especially where trade costs were initially high. Empirically, I use detailed firm-level data from China and a network-based instrument to show that highway expansion reduces markup dispersion and lowers SO<sub>2</sub> and COD emissions intensity at the province level, consistent with improved resource allocation. Using geospatial highway data and a complementary instrumental variable strategy, I further document reductions in emissions intensity at the county level. These results reveal an overlooked environmental co-benefit of transport infrastructure, highlighting its potential to jointly enhance economic efficiency and environmental sustainability.
